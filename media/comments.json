      "body": "Historically `t.column` was the original way to create columns in migrations and `add_column` is assumed to be the same thing for existing tables. Both methods should be equal except for that, and that's why the documentation refers to `column`, because their documentation should be equal mod the table and you do not want to maintain both of them in sync.\n\nThe `:index` option for `column` is really recent (see https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9a0d35e8) and new in 4.2 if I am not mistaken.\n\nIn my opinion, if we are fine with allowing column creation in new tables to be able to also create an index, then the same criteria should be applied to newly created columns for existing tables. The interface should be equal.\n\nI have no strong opinion about allowing `:index` or not, indeed I agree with @rafaelfranca (in the referenced ticket) that creating a column could well be restricted to do that and nothing else. I would be fine reverting that change, but in either case, I do believe both APIs should be in sync and in consequence the API of  `add_column` should be able to delegate to the docs of `column` as it does today.\n",
