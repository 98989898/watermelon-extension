Watermelon is an IDE extension that brings in answers of _why_ a piece of code was written.

We take the Github PR comments to give you all the context in plain English.

Jira and Slack integrations coming soon.

To use watermelon call the command menu with `CTRL + SHIFT+ P ` (or `CMD + SHIFT+ P ` in Mac)
and type `Watermelon`.

Now, while the panel is open, any code you select will start a request for context. Depending on the size of your github history, this might take a while.
