Watermelon is an **open-source** integration between **GitHub** and **Visual Studio Code**. Watermelon makes you an expert on any file instantly by running Git blame for you and telling you why a block of code was written that way by someone else.

Watermelon allows you to highlight a piece of code to obtain its historical context.

## Usage
To use watermelon call the command menu with `CTRL + SHIFT+ P ` (or `CMD + SHIFT+ P ` in Mac)
and type `Watermelon`.

Now, while the panel is open, any code you select will start a request for context. Depending on the size of your github history, this might take a while.

## Requirements

* macOS 10.11+, Windows 7+ or Linux
* Visual Studio Code v1.65.0+
* You must have Git locally installed

## Installation

Download from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WatermelonTools.watermelon-tools)
